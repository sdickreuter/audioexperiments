# Audio Experiments

Some little programms written in [nim](https://nim-lang.org/) to perform auditive experiments.
They use [nim sdl2](https://github.com/nim-lang/sdl2) and [illwill](https://github.com/johnnovak/illwill).
(Thanks to the authors of those awesome modules !)

## binauralaudio
Generates sine-waves with different frequency for left and right channel.

## frequencymodulation
Generates a sine-wave where the frequency is modulated also by a sine.

## volumethreshold
Generates sinusoidal tone pairs with a small difference in volume.
